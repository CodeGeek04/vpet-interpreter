# Integration Guide

## Initialize Open-Interpreter

In `main.swift`, add:

```swift
let contentView = ContentView()
let petEntity = PetEntity()
contentView.recordAndRecognizeSpeech()
petEntity.executeActionBasedOnResponse(response: "Play")
petEntity.simulateSystemLevelCommand(response: "Mouse")
```

## Handle Voice I/O

Use macOS speech recognition and text-to-speech APIs to handle voice input and output. The `ContentView` class includes methods for recording and recognizing speech, and speaking text.

## Additional Features

To enable mouse control, use macOS APIs like `CGEvent` to simulate mouse events based on pet actions. The `PetEntity` class includes a method for simulating system-level commands.
